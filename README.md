SUCCESS IS NOT FINAL


A lot of things, sometimes, all want to escape, but really also can not escape, since so, it is better to have a good heart to do things well,

Sometimes, I want to do all kinds of things, thinking about the impact of the environment, but the real reason is that I am not focused enough to do things well. After all, with such age, there are a few things that can do things well

I have been a bit impetuous recently. My work is not so focused. I know I have many things to do and I need to change, but I am still not good at it

Recently, my work and life have not been dealt with very well, which is rather embarrassing. I hope there will be a good place to return.
Practice, an introduction to learning algorithms, and design patterns will take into account the important tasks of recent learning

After several days of wasted time, I finally started writing a new project, react-native. I hope I can stick to it and roll up my sleeves and work hard
